# Luma.SmartHub.Controllino
Arduino firmware for [Controllino](https://controllino.biz/) to control lights (by relays) using [MySensors](https://www.mysensors.org/) library.

This code is written for Controllino MEGA, but after small changes will also work with Controllino MAXI (ethernet chip requred).

Module can work without controller with default input to output mappings. Can be also controlled by MySensors compatible controller (for now). In the future can be also controlled by [Luma.SmartHub](https://github.com/czesiu/Luma.SmartHub).

More information (connections schematics) will be available soon. Questions can be posted on main project [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/czesiu/Luma.SmartHub).
